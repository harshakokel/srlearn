# srlearn Contributing Guidelines

Our goal is to make BoostSRL more accessible to the Python community by creating general-purpose wrappers
for the existing software. Any suggestions or contributions which further this goal are welcome.

## Code of Conduct

We have adopted the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read, follow,
and report any incidents which violate this.

## Submitting Issues (bugs and new features):

We use GitHub issues for tracking all bugs and feature requests; feel free to
open an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.

It is recommended to check that your issue complies with the following guidelines
before submitting.

### Feature request

Documentation for requesting features is included in the [feature_request](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) template.

### Filing bugs

We use Github issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to
open an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.

It is recommended to check that your issue complies with the
following rules before submitting:

-  Follow the guidelines in the [bug-report](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md) template.

-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other
   [issues](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn/issues)
   or [pull requests](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn/pulls).

-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in
   appropriate code blocks.
   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).

-  Please include your operating system type and version number, as well
   as your Python, scikit-learn, numpy, and scipy versions. This information
   can be found by running the following code snippet:

   ```bash
   python -c "import srlearn; srlearn.show_versions()"
   ```

-  Please be specific about what estimators and/or functions are involved
   and the shape of the data, as appropriate; please include a
   [reproducible](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) code snippet
   or link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com). If an exception is raised,
   please provide the traceback.

## Contributing Code

This guide is adapted from [imbalanced-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### How to contribute

The preferred way to contribute to `srlearn` is to fork the
[main repository](https://github.com/hayesall/srlearn) on
GitHub:

1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/hayesall/srlearn):
   click on the 'Fork' button near the top of the page. This creates
   a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.

2. Clone this copy to your local disk:

        $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/srlearn.git
        $ cd srlearn

3. Create a branch to hold your changes:

        $ git checkout -b my-feature

   and start making changes. Never work in the `main` branch!

4. Work on this copy on your computer using Git to do the version
   control. When you're done editing, do:

        $ git add modified_files
        $ git commit

   to record your changes in Git, then push them to GitHub with:

        $ git push -u origin my-feature

Finally, go to the web page of your fork of the srlearn repo,
and click 'Pull request' to send your changes to the maintainers for
review.

(If any of the above seems like magic to you, then look up the
[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web.)

### Contributing Pull Requests

It is recommended to check that your contribution complies with the
following rules before submitting a pull request:

-  If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the title to describe
   the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request description to
   ensure a link is created to the original issue.

-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample
   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.

-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` if the
   contribution is complete and should be subjected to a detailed review.
   Incomplete contributions should be prefixed `[WIP]` to indicate a work
   in progress (and changed to `[MRG]` when it matures). WIPs may be useful
   to: indicate you are working on something to avoid duplicated work,
   request broad review of functionality or API, or seek collaborators.
   WIPs often benefit from the inclusion of a
   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)
   in the PR description.

-  All other tests pass when everything is rebuilt from scratch. On
   Unix-like systems, check with (from the toplevel source folder):

        $ make test

-  When adding additional functionality, provide at least one
   example script in the `docs/examples/` folder. Have a look at other
   examples for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new
   functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it
   to other methods available in srlearn.

-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements
   to be accepted.

-  At least one paragraph of narrative documentation with links to
   references in the literature (with PDF links when possible) and
   the example.

You can also check for common programming errors with the following
tools:

- Code with good unittest coverage (at least 80%), check with:

        $ pip install pytest pytest-cov
        $ pytest --cov=srlearn srlearn

- Code *style* is formatted automatically with `black`

        $ pip install black
        $ black srlearn/

- But `black` cannot automatically fix all style problems, see `pycodestyle`
  for pep8 compliance

        $ pip install pycodestyle
        $ pycodestyle srlearn/

- Linting with `pylint` helps catch common issues (keep rating above 9.0).

        $ pip install pylint
        $ pylint srlearn/

### Documentation

We are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,
reStructuredText documents, tutorials, etc. reStructuredText documents
live in the source code repository under the `docs/` directory.

You can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate
the HTML output by typing `make html` from the docs/ directory.
The resulting HTML files will be placed in `build/html/` and are viewable
in a web browser. See the README file in the doc/ directory for more information.

For building the documentation, you will need
[sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org),
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), and
[pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io).

When you are writing documentation, it is important to keep a good
compromise between mathematical and algorithmic details, and give
intuition to the reader on what the algorithm does. It is best to always
start with a small paragraph with a hand-waving explanation of what the
method does to the data and a figure (coming from an example)
illustrating it.
